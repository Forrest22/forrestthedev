        <br />
        I am a full-stack software engineer who enjoys building thoughtful and
        reliable systems from clean APIs to polished user experiences. I care
        about maintainability, collaboration, and shipping things that actually
        make people's lives better. I've spent most of my career working on
        large scale, high impact platforms, and I'm especially motivated by
        products that prioritize quality, usability, and developer experience.
        <br />
        <h2 class="center">About Me</h2>
        I'm a software engineer with experience across the stack, but I'm
        especially comfortable owning backend services and the systems around
        them. I enjoy working on problems where good design, clear abstractions,
        and long term maintainability really matter. Most recently, I worked at
        Workday on a developer experience platform used by millions of
        developers. My work ranged from designing and maintaining backend APIs
        and infrastructure to building custome focused UXs in React. That cross
        stack experience has made me an adaptive engineer — I think a lot about
        how systems are used, not just how they're built. Check out more of my
        experience and work below:
